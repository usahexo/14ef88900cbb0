        <h1 id="How-Many-Five-Card-Poker-Hands-Contain-One-or-More-Twos"><a href="#How-Many-Five-Card-Poker-Hands-Contain-One-or-More-Twos" class="headerlink" title="How Many Five Card Poker Hands Contain One or More Twos?"></a>How Many Five Card Poker Hands Contain One or More Twos?</h1><p>In a standard deck of 52 cards, there are 4 twos. So, if you were to draw 5 cards at random, the probability of getting one or more twos is 4/52. </p>
<p>To calculate how many five card poker hands contain one or more twos, we need to multiply the probability by the number of possible hands: </p>
<p>4/52 * 5 = 20</p>
<h1 id="Are-You-Playing-Five-Card-Draw-With-One-or-More-Twos"><a href="#Are-You-Playing-Five-Card-Draw-With-One-or-More-Twos" class="headerlink" title="Are You Playing Five Card Draw With One or More Twos?"></a>Are You Playing Five Card Draw With One or More Twos?</h1><p>In poker, the five card draw is one of the simplest variants. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to be the first player to score exactly 21 points, or to have the highest score when the other player(s) run out of cards. If you are playing against others, the player with the lowest score at the end of the hand is out of the game.</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt five cards face down, and one face up. The face-up card is placed in front of the player and becomes their “ripper.” The remainder of the deck is placed in the middle of the players, face down. </p>
<p>The player to the dealer’s left goes first and must decide whether they want to keep all five cards, or whether they want to discard one or more and receive replacements. If they choose to discard, they must place their cards in a separate stack in front of them, face down. After discarding, they draw replacement cards from the deck until they have five again. Once they have decided what to do, their turn passes to the next player on their left who then has the same options. Play passes clockwise around the table like this until everyone has either chosen to keep all their cards or discarded all but five. </p>
<p>After everyone has had a chance to discard (or not), whoever has five cards starts putting them down one at a time in front of them face up. When any player has put down all five of their cards (or four plus an ace), that player wins and scores points as follows: </p>
<p>One point for each Ace<br>2 points for each 2<br>3 points for each 3<br>4 points for each 4<br>5 points for each 5</p>
<p>If two or more players have scored 21 after putting down all their cards, then whichever player has higher value individual card wins (Aces are high). For example: Player A has an Ace and a 2; Player B has two 6s. Player A would win as they have higher value individual card (Ace is high).</p>
<h1 id="Odds-of-Getting-a-Five-Card-Poker-Hand-With-One-or-More-Twos"><a href="#Odds-of-Getting-a-Five-Card-Poker-Hand-With-One-or-More-Twos" class="headerlink" title="Odds of Getting a Five Card Poker Hand With One or More Twos"></a>Odds of Getting a Five Card Poker Hand With One or More Twos</h1><p>In poker, the odds of getting any given hand are calculated by dividing the number of ways of achieving the hand by the number of possible hands. This is also referred to as the Hand Odds or Probability.</p>
<p>For example, the odds of getting a royal flush (10-J-Q-K-A) are 649,739 to 1. This means that there are 649,739 possible royal flushes and only 1 way to get one.</p>
<p>The odds of getting a five card poker hand with one or more twos are as follows:</p>
<p>There are 10 possible five card hands with one or more twos:<br>2♦, 2♥, 2♠, 2♣, 3♦, 3♥, 3♠, 3♣, 4♦, 4♥.</p>
<p>There are 45 possible five card hands without any twos:<br>A♦, A♥, A♠, A♣, 2♦, 2♥, 2♣, 3♦, 3♥, 3♠, 3♣,…4♦.</p>
<p>The odds of getting a five card poker hand with one or more twos is 9/45 = 20%.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-Chances-of-Getting-a-Pair-of-Twos-in-Five-Card-Poker"><a href="#What-are-the-Chances-of-Getting-a-Pair-of-Twos-in-Five-Card-Poker" class="headerlink" title="What are the Chances of Getting a Pair of Twos in Five Card Poker?"></a>What are the Chances of Getting a Pair of Twos in Five Card Poker?</h1><p>In poker, the chances of getting any one particular card are 1 in 52. This applies to both face cards and non-face cards. So, the chances of getting a pair of twos in five card poker are 1 in 2,598.</p>
<p>There are several different ways to calculate the odds of getting a pair of twos in five card poker. One way is to use a basic formula that takes into account the number of possible outcomes and the number of desired outcomes. In this case, there are 635 possible outcomes (since there are 52 cards in the deck, 5 random cards drawn, and each has 2 possible outcomes) and only 2 desired outcomes (a pair of twos). This gives us a probability of getting a pair of twos as 3.16%.</p>
<p>Another way to calculate the odds is by using a diagram. In this case, we would start with an empty diagram and then fill it in as we draw cards. The first card is always random, so it goes in any spot. The second card is then drawn and placed next to the first card. If the two cards are not the same rank, then we move on to the next card and draw again. If they are the same rank, then we have our pair of twos and stop drawing cards. This method results in a 31% chance of getting a pair of twos (since there are 4 pairs out of 13 total ranks).</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-Five-Card-Poker-When-You-Have-One-or-More-Twos"><a href="#How-to-Play-Five-Card-Poker-When-You-Have-One-or-More-Twos" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Five Card Poker When You Have One or More Twos"></a>How to Play Five Card Poker When You Have One or More Twos</h1><p>In poker, the game is played with a deck of 52 cards. The ranking of the cards is as follows: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. The object of the game is to make the best possible five-card hand by selecting any five cards from your seven-card hand. In order to win the pot in a poker game, your five-card hand must rank higher than that of any other player at the table.</p>
<p>If you are playing with one or more twos in your hand then there are specific strategies that you will want to employ in order to best play your cards. With one or more twos in your hand you have four potential high hands: 222 (two twos), 333 (three twos), 444 (four twos), and 555 (five twos). Of these four high hands, 333 and 444 are the most powerful since they contain two different suits. If you are playing against opponents who are holding only low cards in their hands (2s through 4s), then your best strategy is to discard all of your low cards and try to make a high hand using only your two higher ranked cards.</p>
<p>If you are playing against opponents who are holding medium or high ranked cards in their hands (5s through King), then you will want to keep all of your low cards in order to make a five-card hand containing two different suits. Since there are only two possible ways to make a high hand with two different suits (333 or 444), it is important that you keep all of your low cards so that you don’t miss out on this opportunity.</p>
<p>If you are dealt two twos as your first two cards then it is usually best to hold onto them and hope for another two card set to appear on the table. This would give you three twos for a strong high hand such as 555. If an Ace appears on the table then you can also use it to form a strong Ace High Hand such as AKQJT. However, if an Ace does not appear on the table then it might be wise to discard both of your twos and hope for better replacement cards.</p>

        <h1 id="Djibouti-Becomes-a-Blackjack-Hot-Spot-With-World-Class-Ace-Counting-Skills"><a href="#Djibouti-Becomes-a-Blackjack-Hot-Spot-With-World-Class-Ace-Counting-Skills" class="headerlink" title="Djibouti Becomes a Blackjack Hot Spot With World-Class Ace Counting Skills"></a>Djibouti Becomes a Blackjack Hot Spot With World-Class Ace Counting Skills</h1><p>A group of seasoned blackjack players from around the world descended on Djibouti in November of last year, and the small East African country has not been the same since. The group, who refer to themselves as the “Acehood Casino Clan”, has brought with them a world-class ace counting skillset that has made them one of the most successful blackjack teams in the world.</p>
<p>Djibouti is not a gambler’s paradise by any means - in fact, there are only two casinos in the entire country. But that hasn’t stopped the Acehood Casino Clan from turning these casinos into their personal playground. In the past few months, they have taken home over $200,000 in winnings, and they show no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>How have they been able to achieve such success? Simply put, they have mastered the art of ace counting. By keeping track of which cards have already been played, they can make informed betting decisions that give them a statistical edge over the house. And while this technique is certainly not new, the Acehood Casino Clan is one of the few teams to have perfected it.</p>
<p>So how does this all work? Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<p>Suppose you are playing a game of blackjack at a casino that uses eight decks of cards. If you are keeping track of which cards have already been played, you will know that there are only 16 Aces left in the deck (4 Aces per deck times 8 decks = 32 Aces). This means that the odds of getting an Ace on your next card are only 16/52, or about 31%.</p>
<p>By making a smart bet based on this information, you can give yourself a significant advantage over the house. In fact, if you always bet on getting an Ace when there are only 16 left in the deck, you would expect to win about 50% of your hands - more than enough to make a profit over time.</p>
<p>Of course, things aren’t quite that simple in real life. The Acehood Casino Clan uses a variety of complex strategies when betting, and there is no guarantee that you will always win money by using this system. However, if you are good at counting cards and know when to bet big and when to hold back, you can definitely give yourself an edge over the casino.</p>
<h1 id="Expert-Djiboutian-Players-Can-Make-an-Ace-Count-as-Much-as-3-Points"><a href="#Expert-Djiboutian-Players-Can-Make-an-Ace-Count-as-Much-as-3-Points" class="headerlink" title="Expert Djiboutian Players Can Make an Ace Count as Much as 3 Points"></a>Expert Djiboutian Players Can Make an Ace Count as Much as 3 Points</h1><p>In tennis, an ace is a serve that lands in the opposition’s court without being touched by them. It is frequently the best way to start a point. In doubles, an ace can be worth up to three points if it forces the other team to make a mistake. When an expert Djiboutian player serves, they can make an ace count as much as three points.</p>
<p>Djiboutian players are often some of the best in the world at serving. This is because Djibouti is a small country with a lot of hot weather. This makes it the perfect place to practice and perfect one’s serve. Djiboutian players have learned how to use the heat and their country’s small size to their advantage on the tennis court.</p>
<p>When an expert Djiboutian player serves, they can make an ace count as much as three points. This is because their opponents will often not be expecting such a strong serve, especially from a smaller country like Djibouti. The hot weather also helps to create more speed on the ball, making it more difficult for opponents to return it.</p>
<p>Djiboutian players are often some of the best in the world at serving</p>
<p>Djiboutian players have been able to achieve so much success on the tennis court thanks to their strong service game. Their ability to make an ace count as much as three points often gives them an edge over their opponents. With more and more Djiboutian players starting to compete on the professional circuit, we are sure to see even more impressive service games in years to come.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Ace-Count-in-Blackjack-like-a-Djiboutian-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Ace-Count-in-Blackjack-like-a-Djiboutian-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Ace Count in Blackjack like a Djiboutian Pro"></a>How to Ace Count in Blackjack like a Djiboutian Pro</h1><p>One of the key skills for any blackjack player is counting cards. This allows players to get an edge over the casino by knowing when the odds are in their favor. Counting cards is a skill that can be mastered with some practice. Here are some tips to help you ace counting in blackjack like a djiboutian pro.</p>
<p>The first step is to learn the basic counting system. This involves keeping track of the number of high and low cards that have been played. In general, high cards favour the player, while low cards favour the casino. As each card is played, you simply add or subtract 1 from your running total, depending on whether it is high or low.</p>
<p>Some people find it helpful to use a pen and paper to keep track of the running total, while others prefer to use mental math. Whichever method you choose, it’s important to practice until you can do it quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Once you have mastered the basic counting system, you can start practicing how to use it in a real game. The most important thing is to stay calm and focused, even when the dealer is hitting soft 17 or bonuses are being paid out. It’s also important to be aware of your surroundings and avoid getting distracted.</p>
<p>Most importantly, remember that counting cards is only one tool in your blackjack arsenal. It should not be used as a substitute for good strategy and smart decision-making. With a little practice, though, you can use counting to give yourself an edge over the casino and increase your chances of winning big!</p>

Bolkiah’s record-breaking run began on a Tuesday evening, where he walked away with a total of $29,700 after playing for just four hours.</p>
<p>The following evening, the 43-year-old djiboutian repeated his success, banking an additional $24,000. In addition to his winnings from blackjack, Bolkiah also reportedly raked in over $100,000 from other casino games during his stay in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>When asked about his phenomenal winning streak, Bolkiah credited his good fortune to months of practice and intense focus on the game. “I have been playing blackjack for many years and I know what to do in any situation. I was very confident going into these games and it paid off big time.”</p>
<p>Bolkiah is no stranger to big wins; he previously won over $1 million while playing blackjack at an Atlantic City casino in 2013. However, this latest victory is by far his most impressive yet and has cemented his reputation as one of the world’s top blackjack players.</p>
<h1 id="Djiboutian-Card-Sharp-Beats-Casino-Out-of-Thousands-with-Perfect-Ace-Counting"><a href="#Djiboutian-Card-Sharp-Beats-Casino-Out-of-Thousands-with-Perfect-Ace-Counting" class="headerlink" title="Djiboutian Card-Sharp Beats Casino Out of Thousands - with Perfect Ace Counting"></a>Djiboutian Card-Sharp Beats Casino Out of Thousands - with Perfect Ace Counting</h1><p>In a stunning upset at the Casino du Liban this weekend, Djiboutian Moustapha Djalil outlasted casino staff and fellow gamblers alike, taking home thousands of dollars with a nearly perfect ace counting strategy.</p>
<p>Djalil, who has been card counting since he was a teenager, entered the casino on Saturday morning with the express purpose of winning big. “I knew the odds were in my favor,” he said after his victory. With a little more than an hour of play, Djalil had run up a progressive jackpot worth over $10,000.</p>
<p>How does card counting work? In blackjack, the dealer deals out two cards to each player and to herself. The object of the game is to draw cards until you have a total that is as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes the best hand.</p>
<p>The dealer also draws two cards, but one is placed face down so that only she knows its value. When it’s player’s turn to hit (take another card), they can ask the dealer for any number of cards - generally between one and five.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about busting (going over 21), you can also choose to stand (not take any more cards). The riskier move is hitting, because if you go over 21 you lose automatically - even if the dealer subsequently goes bust too.</p>
<p>At any point in the game, then, the player needs to make two decisions: how many cards to take and whether to hit or stand. In order to count cards effectively, the player needs to keep track of how many low and high cards remain in the deck.</p>
<p>Most casinos deal around eight decks of cards per table - so there are 416 cards in total. When there are more low cards left in the deck (2s, 3s, 4s and 5s), then it’s statistically more likely that the dealer will bust if she hits again. This is because there are fewer high-value cards left in the deck to cancel out her total should she hit again. So a card counter would bet more when there are lots of low cards left in the deck - and less when there are lots of high-value cards left.</p>
<p>Casinos don’t like card counters because they have an edge over the house - so they often get banned from playing altogether. But Moustapha Djalil proved this weekend that with a little practice and some careful planning, anyone can beat the casino at its own game.</p>

        <h1 id="The-US-to-Dominate-the-Global-Gambling-Market"><a href="#The-US-to-Dominate-the-Global-Gambling-Market" class="headerlink" title="The US to Dominate the Global Gambling Market"></a>The US to Dominate the Global Gambling Market</h1><p>The global gambling market is expected to be worth $116.9 billion by the end of 2020, with the United States accounting for the majority of that revenue. This prediction comes from a new report from Research and Markets, which expects the American gambling market to grow at a compound annual rate of 5.4% over the next four years.</p>
<p>This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing legalization of gambling in the US, rising income levels, and the growing popularity of online gambling. The report notes that states such as Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware are leading the way in terms of online gambling revenue growth.</p>
<p>In fact, online gambling is expected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the global gambling market, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 11.5% between 2020 and 2024. This growth is being driven by several factors, including technological advancements, consumer preferences for convenience and flexibility, and rising demand from emerging markets such as Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>Overall, the global gambling market is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.5% between 2020 and 2024. While the US will remain the dominant player in this market, other regions such as Europe and Asia Pacific are expected to see significant growth in terms of revenue over the next few years.</p>
<h1 id="US-Gambling-Market-to-Grow-5-Annually"><a href="#US-Gambling-Market-to-Grow-5-Annually" class="headerlink" title="US Gambling Market to Grow 5% Annually"></a>US Gambling Market to Grow 5% Annually</h1><p>The US gambling market is expected to experience steady growth in the coming years, with revenues forecast to increase by 5% annually. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the legalization of online gambling, the introduction of new gaming products, and the increasing popularity of casino vacations.</p>
<p>The legalization of online gambling has been a major boon for the industry, with revenues from internet betting expected to reach $5.8 billion by 2020. This growth is being propelled by the increasing availability of mobile devices and the widespread acceptance of online gambling among consumers. In addition, states are increasingly legalizing online gambling, providing a larger pool of potential customers.</p>
<p>Casinos are also introducing new gaming products to entice consumers. Slot machines, for example, are now incorporating video game themes and features, making them more appealing to younger players. In addition, casinos are offering more exotic gambling experiences, such as those found in Las Vegas or Macau. These new offerings are helping to drive tourism and spending on gaming products.</p>
<p>Finally, casino vacations are becoming increasingly popular among American travelers. These vacations offer a combination of gaming and leisure activities, allowing people to enjoy some excitement while also getting away from home. The growing demand for these vacations is helping to drive spending on gambling products.</p>
<p>All these factors are helping to propel the growth of the US gambling market and should result in substantial increases in revenues over the next few years.</p>
<h1 id="US-Expected-to-Control-45-of-Gambling-Market-by-2020"><a href="#US-Expected-to-Control-45-of-Gambling-Market-by-2020" class="headerlink" title="US Expected to Control 45% of Gambling Market by 2020"></a>US Expected to Control 45% of Gambling Market by 2020</h1><p>The gambling market is expected to grow exponentially by 2020. The United States is expected to control 45% of the global gambling market, up from 36% in 2017. Most of this growth is attributed to the increasing popularity of sports betting and the expansion of legalized gambling in new jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The U.S. gambling market is forecast to reach $196 billion by 2020, up from $154 billion in 2017, according to a report from research firm H2 Gambling Capital. That includes revenue from casinos, online gambling, sports betting and race betting. The global market is expected to grow even faster, reaching $556 billion by 2020, up from $445 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>The expansion of legalized gambling in new jurisdictions is a major factor driving growth in the global market. In the United States, for example, 11 states have now legalized some form of sports betting following a Supreme Court decision last year overturning a federal ban on the activity. Other countries are also moving towards liberalization, with China expected to soon take steps that could open its huge casino market to outside investors.</p>
<p>Another key driver of growth is the increasing popularity of sports betting. This type of gambling has been growing rapidly in recent years as fans seek ways to bet on their favorite teams and players. In the U.S., for example, revenue from sports betting is expected to reach $14.8 billion by 2020, up from $5.6 billion in 2017.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports betting across multiple U.S. states has driven impressive growth within that country’s overall gaming market,” said H2 Gambling Capital CEO Packer Hassleben in a statement accompanying the report’s release. “This forms part of a larger trend we are seeing around the world; as more jurisdictions legalize different types of gaming activity, overall revenues continue to climb.”</p>
<h1 id="The-Future-of-Gambling-The-US-Market"><a href="#The-Future-of-Gambling-The-US-Market" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Gambling: The US Market"></a>The Future of Gambling: The US Market</h1><p>The gambling industry has been around for centuries, and it doesn’t look like it will be going away any time soon. In fact, in recent years, the gambling industry has been growing at a rapid pace. This is particularly true in the United States, where the market for gambling is expected to reach $60.5 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>So, what is driving this growth? There are a number of factors, but one of the most important is technology. With the advent of online casinos and betting platforms, it has become easier than ever to gamble. And with smartphones becoming more and more ubiquitous, there is now an even greater demand for mobile gambling apps.</p>
<p>Another factor that is driving growth is regulatory changes. In recent years, many states have relaxed their gambling laws, making it easier for casinos and other gambling establishments to operate. And as more and more states legalize gambling, the market is expected to continue to grow.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the biggest drivers of growth in the US gambling market is demographic changes. The population of the US is aging and retirees are increasingly turning to gambling as a way to pass their time. This trend is likely to continue in the years ahead, leading to even faster growth in the gambling market.</p>
<p>Overall, the outlook for the US gambling market is very positive. With continued growth in technology and regulatory changes, as well as an aging population, the market is expected to reach $60.5 billion by 2023. So if you’re interested in investing in or operating a casino or other gambling establishment, now is definitely a good time to do so.</p>
<h1 id="US-is-the-Top-Country-for-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#US-is-the-Top-Country-for-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="US is the Top Country for Gambling Revenue"></a>US is the Top Country for Gambling Revenue</h1><p>The gambling industry is booming in the United States, with the country generating far more revenue from gambling than any other country. In 2017, the US generated $43.6 billion in gambling revenue, more than twice as much as second-place China ($21.6 billion) and more than six times as much as third-place Japan ($7.3 billion).</p>
<p>The strong performance of the US gambling industry is due to a number of factors. First, there is a large and diverse population of gamblers in the US. Americans love to gamble, and there are a wide variety of gambling options available to them, from traditional casino games like slots and blackjack to newer offerings like eSports betting and bitcoin gambling.</p>
<p>Second, the US has relaxed its gambling laws in recent years, making it easier for casinos to operate and for people to gamble online. This has led to a sharp increase in the number of people who gamble, and a corresponding increase in revenue.</p>
<p>Finally, the US gaming industry is well funded and technologically advanced, thanks in part to the huge profits it generates. This allows casinos to offer top-notch gaming experiences and attract players from around the world.</p>
<p>The future looks bright for the US gambling industry. With continued population growth and further relaxation of gambling laws, revenue is likely to continue increasing at a brisk pace. This will make the US one of the top destinations for gamblers worldwide, and provide a significant boost to the economy.</p>

        <h1 id="Illinois-Could-Get-Millions-in-New-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Illinois-Could-Get-Millions-in-New-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Could Get Millions in New Gambling Revenue"></a>Illinois Could Get Millions in New Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Governor Bruce Rauner says that Illinois could get millions in new gambling revenue if it allows casinos to be built in Chicago and other locations around the state. The governor made his proposal as the state faces a $6.2 billion budget crisis.</p>
<p>Rauner is proposing that lawmakers approve five new casinos, including one in Chicago. He estimates that the new casinos would generate $1.2 billion in new revenue each year. The proposal also includes relaxed rules on slot machines and table games, which could bring in an additional $200 million annually.</p>
<p>State lawmakers are skeptical of the governor’s proposal, noting that it would require a change in the state constitution. They’re also not sure that casino gambling is the answer to Illinois’ budget crisis.</p>
<p>Opponents of expanded gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial problems for people who can least afford it. They also say that the money from gambling goes to casino operators rather than to state coffers.</p>
<p>Casino proponents argue that the industry already exists in Illinois and that legalizing casinos would bring much-needed revenue to the state. They also note that casino gambling is heavily regulated and that problem gamblers can get help through programs offered by casino operators.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Poised-to-Gain-from-Increased-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Illinois-Poised-to-Gain-from-Increased-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Poised to Gain from Increased Gambling Revenue"></a>Illinois Poised to Gain from Increased Gambling Revenue</h1><p>The state of Illinois is expecting to see a significant increase in gambling revenue in the coming years. This is thanks to the legalization of gambling expansion in the state, which will allow for six new casinos to be built. Revenue from gambling is expected to grow by $350 million annually, with a total of $1.2 billion in new money being brought in by 2021.</p>
<p>This is great news for the state, which has been struggling with budget deficits for years. The extra money will help to shore up the state’s finances and fund important programs and services. It will also create thousands of new jobs, as the new casinos are built and come online.</p>
<p>In addition to creating jobs and bringing in much-needed revenue, the expanded gambling will also generate millions in tax revenue. This money will be used to help pay for vital public services like education and infrastructure improvements.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a win-win situation for Illinois. Gambling expansion will help to solve some of the state’s financial problems while also providing many benefits for its residents.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Could-Benefit-from-Increased-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Illinois-Could-Benefit-from-Increased-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Could Benefit from Increased Gambling Revenue"></a>Illinois Could Benefit from Increased Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Illinois is one of the states in the US that has seen its gambling revenue drop in recent years. This is due to a number of factors, including increased competition from neighboring states and the growth of online gambling.</p>
<p>However, if Illinois were to legalize online gambling and increase its gaming tax rates, it could see its gambling revenue increase by as much as $300 million per year.</p>
<p>This would be a major boon for the state, which is currently facing significant budget problems. It would also help to create jobs and generate much-needed economic growth.</p>
<p> opposition to gambling legalization in Illinois is likely to be strong. However, with the right approach, it is possible to win over skeptical lawmakers and voters.</p>
<p>The first step is to show that increasing gambling revenue will help to solve the state’s fiscal problems. This can be done by estimating how much money Illinois could make from online gambling and other forms of gaming.</p>
<p>The next step is to argue that this money could be used to fund important programs and services. This can be done by highlighting how other states have used gambling revenue to improve education, infrastructure, and healthcare.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to stress that legalization will only be successful if it is properly regulated. This means implementing strong consumer protection measures, ensuring that minors cannot gamble, and preventing gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-on-Track-to-Bring-in-Millions-in-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Illinois-on-Track-to-Bring-in-Millions-in-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Illinois on Track to Bring in Millions in Gambling Revenue"></a>Illinois on Track to Bring in Millions in Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Illinois lawmakers are pushing for a gambling expansion that is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue. The proposed bill would allow for six new casinos, including one in Chicago.</p>
<p>Supporters say the measure would create jobs and help the state’s economy, while opponents argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems. Governor Bruce Rauner has not yet said if he will sign the bill into law if it passes.</p>
<p>If the measure is approved, the new casinos would be up and running within two years. The bill also calls for a new $60 million license fee for casino operators, as well as a new 34 percent tax on gaming revenue.</p>
<p>In addition to the Chicago casino, the other five casinos would be located in Rockford, Danville, Springfield, Rosemont, and Chicago’s south suburbs. The measure would also allow for video gambling at truck stops and airports.</p>
<p>The proposal has been met with some resistance in the state legislature, where some lawmakers are concerned about the potential social costs of expanded gambling. But supporters say that Illinois already has some of the most stringent regulations in place when it comes to gambling addiction, and that any problems can be addressed through additional regulation.</p>
<p>Governor Rauner has not taken a position on the bill yet, but he is under pressure from lawmakers to sign it if it passes. State lawmakers are hoping to have a vote on the measure before the end of the year.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Poised-to-Net-Millions-in-New-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#Illinois-Poised-to-Net-Millions-in-New-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Poised to Net Millions in New Gambling Revenue"></a>Illinois Poised to Net Millions in New Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Illinois lawmakers have put the finishing touches on a bill that would legalize sports betting, poker, and other forms of gambling in the state. If approved, Illinois would become the fourth state in the nation to offer legal sports betting, and it could generate millions of dollars in new revenue for the government.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, people over 21 years of age would be able to bet on sports at licensed casinos and online. The legislation also allows for poker and other casino games to be played online.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are optimistic that the new gambling revenue will help plug some of the state’s budget deficits. Governor Bruce Rauner has already indicated that he supports the measure, and it is expected to pass both legislative chambers with little opposition.</p>
<p>If approved, Illinois would join Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey as states that have legalized sports betting. Nevada is currently the only state that offers legal sports betting nationwide, but other states are likely to follow Illinois’ lead if the bill is successful.</p>

        <h1 id="How-Casinos-Use-Psychology-to-Keep-You-gambling"><a href="#How-Casinos-Use-Psychology-to-Keep-You-gambling" class="headerlink" title="How Casinos Use Psychology to Keep You gambling"></a>How Casinos Use Psychology to Keep You gambling</h1><p>One of the most interesting things about casinos is how they use psychology to keep you gambling. From the moment you walk in, they are trying to get you to spend as much money as possible. And it works – most people lose more money than they intended when they go to a casino.</p>
<p>So how do casinos do it? There are a few tricks that they use, which we will look at below.</p>
<p>The first thing that casinos do is make sure that the environment is conducive to gambling. This means that the lights are dimmed and there is lots of noise and excitement. This creates a feeling of excitement and pleasure, which encourages you to keep gambling.</p>
<p>They also use visual cues to encourage you to gamble. For example, they will have stacks of money or piles of chips in view, which makes you think that you could win big if you gamble enough. They also use games with bright colors and fast-paced action, which further encourages you to gamble.</p>
<p>Casinos also use psychological techniques such as positive reinforcement and loss aversion. Positive reinforcement means giving players rewards for gambling, such as free drinks, complimentary snacks, and even VIP treatment. This makes players feel good and encourages them to keep gambling. Loss aversion means making players feel like they are losing out if they don’t gamble, which can be very effective in encouraging people to keep playing.</p>
<p>Overall, casinos use a number of psychological techniques to keep you gambling longer. If you are aware of these techniques before heading to the casino, you can be better prepared for them and hopefully avoid losing too much money!</p>
<h1 id="The-Science-Behind-How-Casinos-Keep-you-Gambling"><a href="#The-Science-Behind-How-Casinos-Keep-you-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="The Science Behind How Casinos Keep you Gambling"></a>The Science Behind How Casinos Keep you Gambling</h1><p>In casinos, there is a technique employed by the staff called “padering” which is used to keep you gambling. This is a technique where the casino staff will adjust the odds of certain games in their favor so that you are more likely to lose money in the long run. In most cases, they do this by making the house edge higher than it should be.</p>
<p>When you walk into a casino, you are greeted with bright lights, loud noises and games of chance. It’s no secret that casinos make billions of dollars each year, and much of this is thanks to the techniques that they use to keep you gambling.</p>
<p>One method that casinos use is known as “padering”. This is a technique where the casino staff will adjust the odds of certain games in their favor so that you are more likely to lose money in the long run. In most cases, they do this by making the house edge higher than it should be. For example, if you were playing blackjack and the house edge was set at 2%, the casino may adjust this to 3% or 4% so that they have a better chance of winning over time.</p>
<p>Another technique that casinos use is known as “the stickman”. This is where one member of staff controls all of the cards that are dealt out onto the table. By doing this, they can ensure that specific cards are not given to players who have a good chance of winning. This increases the chances that these players will lose money in the long run.</p>
<p>Of course, none of these techniques would be effective if people weren’t aware of them. That’s why casinos go to great lengths to keep their methods hidden from public view. They know that if people were aware of how they operated, then they would quickly lose business.</p>
<p>So next time you find yourself inside a casino, remember that there is more going on than meets the eye. The staff are well trained in keeping you gambling for as long as possible, and they won’t hesitate to use any means necessary to achieve this goal.</p>
<h1 id="How-Casinos-Trick-You-Into-Gambling-More"><a href="#How-Casinos-Trick-You-Into-Gambling-More" class="headerlink" title="How Casinos Trick You Into Gambling More"></a>How Casinos Trick You Into Gambling More</h1><p>When you walk into a casino, what is the first thing you see? Slot machines. They line the walls, and often take up the most space in the casino. Casinos know that when you see all those machines, it’s hard to resist giving them a try.</p>
<p>Slot machines are designed to be addictive. They have bright lights and loud noises that make them attractive to gamblers. And they offer quick payouts, which makes people feel like they’re winning even when they’re losing money.</p>
<p>But the biggest trick that casinos use to get you to gamble more is to make sure that there’s always someone winning. You might see people winning jackpots at the slot machines, or collecting their winnings at a blackjack table. This creates the illusion that gambling is a successful venture, and encourages you to gamble more in order to join in on the action.</p>
<p>Casinos also use marketing tactics to get you to gamble more. They might give you free drinks or food, or offer rewards for playing certain games. All of these things are designed to keep you gambling for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>So if you want to avoid spending too much money at a casino, be aware of these tricks that casinos use to get you to gamble more. Stick to playing games that you know you can afford to lose, and resist the temptation of those shiny slot machines!</p>
<h1 id="How-Casinos-Use-Designs-to-Keep-You-Playing"><a href="#How-Casinos-Use-Designs-to-Keep-You-Playing" class="headerlink" title="How Casinos Use Designs to Keep You Playing"></a>How Casinos Use Designs to Keep You Playing</h1><p>When you walk into a casino, the environment is designed to keep you gambling. The bright lights, flashing machines, and ringing bells are all meant to keep you engaged and playing. Casinos use a number of different tactics to keep you gambling, from the environment to the games themselves.</p>
<p>One of the most common tactics used by casinos is the use of design. Casino designers use certain colors, designs, and sounds in their casinos in order to keep you gambling. For example, casinos often use bright colors like red and yellow because they are associated with excitement and energy. They also use designs that are visually stimulating in order to keep your attention on the machines. In addition, casino designers use sounds like bells and music to create a festive atmosphere that encourages gambling.</p>
<p>Casinos also use games that are designed to be addictive. These games have been specifically created to draw you in and keep you playing. Some of these games include slot machines, video poker, and blackjack. These games are typically very easy to play, which makes them attractive to novice gamblers. They also have high payout rates, which encourages people to continue playing.</p>
<p>Finally, casinos use marketing techniques to encourage gambling. They often offer free drinks and food in order to entice people to stay at the casino longer. They also offer promotional prizes and giveaways in order to attract new players.</p>
<p>All of these tactics are designed to keep you in the casino longer so that you can gamble more money. If you are aware of these tactics, you can make sure to avoid them and protect yourself from losing too much money.</p>
<h1 id="Precisely-How-Casinos-Keep-You-Gambling-The-Science-Behind-It-All"><a href="#Precisely-How-Casinos-Keep-You-Gambling-The-Science-Behind-It-All" class="headerlink" title="Precisely How Casinos Keep You Gambling: The Science Behind It All"></a>Precisely How Casinos Keep You Gambling: The Science Behind It All</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem, and casino operators know it. That’s why they employ a variety of methods to keep you gambling, long after you should have quit.</p>
<p>The first technique is designed to get your money in the door as quickly as possible. Casinos offer “comps” – free food, drinks, and other goodies – to lure you in. Once you’re there, they make it difficult to leave by placing temptations all around you. Slot machines are especially effective at keeping you engaged. They make random payouts, called “near misses”, that give players the false hope of winning eventually. This keeps people playing longer than they would otherwise, losing more money in the process.</p>
<p>Casinos also use social psychology to keep you gambling. For example, they might group together slot machines that have similar payout rates, so people feel like they’re making progress. Or they might put high-stakes machines near the entrance and low-stakes machines near the exit, so people are more likely to gamble more money than they intended.</p>
<p>In addition, casinos make use of environmental cues to keep you playing. Bright lights and loud noises create an exciting atmosphere that can be addictive for some people. Additionally, the smell of cigarettes and alcohol can make people feel more comfortable and relaxed, leading them to stay in the casino longer than they should.</p>
<p>All of these techniques work together to keep casinos profitable and addicts addicted. If you find yourself gambling more than you intended, be aware of these tactics and try to resist them. It won’t be easy, but it’s worth it for your health and your wallet!</p>

        <h1 id="Where-in-the-Bible-Does-it-Talk-about-Gambling"><a href="#Where-in-the-Bible-Does-it-Talk-about-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Where in the Bible Does it Talk about Gambling?"></a>Where in the Bible Does it Talk about Gambling?</h1><p>Gambling is a popular activity across the globe, but it is often met with criticism. Some say that gambling is morally wrong, while others claim that it is a sin. So, where in the Bible does it talk about gambling?</p>
<p>There are a few verses in the Bible that mention gambling. The first verse is from Deuteronomy 23:17-18, which says, “You shall not bring the wage of a harlot or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord your God for any votive offering, for both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God.” In this verse, God condemns gambling because it is associated with prostitution and dogfighting.</p>
<p>The second verse that mentions gambling is from 1 Timothy 6:10, which says, “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” In this verse, Paul condemns gambling because it can lead to greed and other sins.</p>
<p>These are the only verses in the Bible that mention gambling specifically. However, there are other verses that can be applied to gambling. For example, Proverbs 13:11 says, “Dishonest money dwindles away, but whoever gathers money little by little makes it grow.” This verse teaches that greediness leads to ruin, which can be applied to gambling. Additionally, Ecclesiastes 5:10 says, “He who loves money will never be satisfied with money; he who loves wealth is never content with his income.” This verse teaches that those who are always seeking more wealth will never be satisfied – which can also be applied to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>So overall, while the Bible doesn’t mention gambling specifically, there are verses that can be applied to it. Gambling can lead to greed and other sins, and it often causes people to lose money instead of gain it.</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Parques-Board-Game-Could-Lead-to-Biblical-Gambling"><a href="#Playing-Parques-Board-Game-Could-Lead-to-Biblical-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Playing Parques Board Game Could Lead to Biblical Gambling"></a>Playing Parques Board Game Could Lead to Biblical Gambling</h1><p>Going to a casino is a popular pastime for people all over the world. But what if there was a board game that simulated the feeling of gambling in a casino? Parques may be just that game.</p>
<p>Parques is a Brazilian board game that has been gaining in popularity in recent years, especially in South America. The game is similar to Monopoly, but with a twist. Players can buy and sell properties, but they can also bet on whether or not they will win or lose a particular turn.</p>
<p>Some evangelical groups in Brazil have actually begun to warn against playing Parques, because they believe it can lead to biblical gambling. They argue that the game can be addictive and lead to financial ruin.</p>
<p>Whether or not you believe that Parques is a gateway to gambling addiction, there’s no doubt that the game can be pretty addictive. I’ve played it with friends and family members, and it’s hard to resist betting on each turn. The anticipation of winning (or losing) money can be quite thrilling.</p>
<p>But is that such a bad thing? Gambling has been around for centuries, and it doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon. So why not enjoy it in the safe confines of a board game?</p>
<p>That’s not to say that Parques is without its risks. Like any other form of gambling, there’s always the chance of losing money. But if you play carefully and don’t bet too much money, then the risks are relatively low.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s up to each individual player whether or not they want to play Parques. If you’re interested in giving it a try, then I recommend checking out one of the many online versions of the game.</p>
<h1 id="Bible-Teaches-About-Gambling-But-Not-in-the-Way-You-Think"><a href="#Bible-Teaches-About-Gambling-But-Not-in-the-Way-You-Think" class="headerlink" title="Bible Teaches About Gambling - But Not in the Way You Think"></a>Bible Teaches About Gambling - But Not in the Way You Think</h1><p>Gambling has always been a contentious issue, with many people feeling strongly both for and against it. The Bible speaks about gambling, but not in the way you might think.</p>
<p>The Bible doesn’t expressly forbid gambling, but it does warn against it. Gambling can be addictive and lead to ruinous financial losses. It can also be a waste of time and create division among friends and family members.</p>
<p>Gambling can also lead to greed, envy, and other sinful attitudes and behaviours. Rather than gamble, we are encouraged to put our trust in God and use the gifts He has given us to help others.</p>
<p>So while the Bible doesn’t explicitly condemn gambling, it does warn against the dangers of this activity. If you’re considering gambling, please prayerfully consider these risks before making a decision.</p>
<h1 id="What-the-Bible-Says-About-Gambling-and-It’s-Not-What-You-Think"><a href="#What-the-Bible-Says-About-Gambling-and-It’s-Not-What-You-Think" class="headerlink" title="What the Bible Says About Gambling (and It’s Not What You Think)"></a>What the Bible Says About Gambling (and It’s Not What You Think)</h1><p>Gambling is often seen as a sin, and the Bible does mention it in a negative light. However, when you look at the Bible more closely, you’ll see that it has a lot to say about gambling, and most of it is positive.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics. What does the Bible say about gambling? The answer is actually quite simple: the Bible doesn’t say anything specifically about gambling. There is no verse that says “gambling is a sin” or “gambling is okay.” So where does this idea that the Bible condemns gambling come from?</p>
<p>The truth is, the Bible doesn’t condemn or condone gambling - it simply doesn’t address the issue. This doesn’t mean that gambling is okay, but it does mean that each person needs to make their own decision based on their own conscience.</p>
<p>So what does the Bible say about gambling?</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at what the Bible says about money. Money is one of the main things involved in gambling, so it’s important to understand God’s perspective on it. In general, God wants us to be wise with our money and to use it for His purposes. He wants us to be generous with our money and to help others in need. He also desires for us to trust Him with our finances and not worry about them.</p>
<p>These principles apply to gambling as well. When we gamble, we are putting our trust in something other than God. We are hoping that we will win money and not lose it. This can be a dangerous mindset, especially if we become addicted to gambling. Gambling can quickly become an obsession, and before we know it, we’re spending all our time and money on it instead of using it for God’s purposes.</p>
<p>However, there is nothing wrong with enjoying a harmless game of chance every once in a while. As long as we are wise with our money and don’t let gambling become an addiction, there is no harm in playing games of chance moderately. In fact, there are some things to consider which make gambling biblically permissible: 1) All forms of gambling involve risk which can lead to increased faith in God; 2) Gambling can be used as an opportunity for evangelism; 3) It can be helpful for fundraising purposes; 4) Gambling can provide entertainment (within limits).</p>
<p>So should you gamble or not? That’s up to you - but remember that God wants us to use our money wisely and carefully consider all the implications of gambling before deciding whether or not to do it.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-in-the-Bible-Is-It-a-Sin"><a href="#Gambling-in-the-Bible-Is-It-a-Sin" class="headerlink" title="Gambling in the Bible: Is It a Sin?"></a>Gambling in the Bible: Is It a Sin?</h1><p>Gambling is a popular pastime in the United States, with people spending billions of dollars on games of chance every year. While some people see gambling as a harmless way to have some fun, others believe that it is a sin that can lead to ruinous financial losses. So what does the Bible say about gambling?</p>
<p>The Bible doesn’t specifically mention gambling, but there are several scriptures that offer guidance on the topic. The most relevant scripture when it comes to gambling is from the book of Proverbs, which says “A wise man keeps his wealth in check, but a foolish man squanders his money” (Proverbs 21:20). This scripture teaches that gambling can be risky and lead to financial losses.</p>
<p>Other scriptures that address gambling include 1 Corinthians 10:31, which says “So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God,” and James 4:17, which says “Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins.” These scriptures teach that we should not engage in activities that are harmful or addictive and that conflict with our faith. Gambling certainly meets both of these criteria!</p>
<p>So is gambling a sin? While there is no definitive answer, based on the scriptures we can see that there are many reasons why Christians should avoid gambling. Gambling can be addictive and lead to financial hardship, and it goes against our belief that every activity should be done for the glory of God. If you’re struggling with a gambling addiction, please reach out for help!</p>

In this article, we’re going to share some tips on how to stay safe and keep your hard-earned cash in your pocket.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is always read the terms and conditions before signing up for an account. This will help you understand the games and what type of wagers are allowed. It’s also important to know what the betting limits are so you don’t end up spending more than you intended.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that not all games are created equal. Some offer better odds than others, so it’s important to choose wisely. For example, blackjack has a low house edge of around 0.5%, while slot machines have a much higher house edge of around 10%. So if you’re looking to maximise your chances of winning, it’s best to stick to table games.</p>
<p>It’s also important to be aware of how easy it is to lose track of time when playing online casino games. Before you know it, hours have passed and you’ve lost all your money! So make sure you set a limit for how much time you’re going to spend gambling each day and stick to it.</p>
<p>Finally, never gamble more than you can afford to lose. There’s no point risking your rent money or grocery money on casino games! If you stick to these tips, you’ll be able to enjoy your time at LeoVegas Casino without worrying about losing too much money.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Gambling-Loss-Can-You-Write-Away-at-Leo-Vegas-Casino"><a href="#How-Much-Gambling-Loss-Can-You-Write-Away-at-Leo-Vegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Much Gambling Loss Can You Write Away at Leo Vegas Casino?"></a>How Much Gambling Loss Can You Write Away at Leo Vegas Casino?</h1><p>Casino gambling can be a fun and exciting way to spend an evening, but it’s important to be aware of the potential for losses before you start playing. At Leo Vegas Casino, you can enjoy a range of great casino games, including slots, table games, and live dealer games. You can also make use of the excellent Leo Vegas Casino bonus offers to get a head start on your gaming.</p>
<p>However, before you start playing, it’s important to understand how much gambling loss you can write off at Leo Vegas Casino. The good news is that you can write off your losses up to the amount of your winnings in any given year. So, if you have a bad night at the casino and lose $1,000, you can deduct that amount from your taxable income. However, if you happen to win $1,000 on the same night, then you won’t be able to write off any of your losses.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that you can only claim gambling losses up to the amount of your taxable income. So, if you earn $50,000 in a year and lose $2,000 at the casino, you can only claim $2,000 in losses for tax purposes. Any excess losses cannot be carried forward or back to other years.</p>
<p>Overall, gambling losses are a valuable tax deduction that can help offset some of the costs associated with gambling. So, if you’re looking to get a little bit of relief from your tax bill this year, make sure to include your gambling losses as part of your deductions.</p>
<h1 id="Are-You-Excited-to-Use-Your-Gambling-Losses-at-LeoVegas-Casino"><a href="#Are-You-Excited-to-Use-Your-Gambling-Losses-at-LeoVegas-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Are You Excited to Use Your Gambling Losses at LeoVegas Casino?"></a>Are You Excited to Use Your Gambling Losses at LeoVegas Casino?</h1><p>A big determination that gamblers face when they gamble is whether to record their gambling losses or not. This mostly depends on the type of gambler you are and also where you gamble. For some, it makes more sense to deduct their losses in order to get a bit of tax relief. On the other hand, others might feel like they’re just asking for more trouble if they report any gambling losses.</p>
<p>The best way to approach this is to speak with an accountant and see what he or she has to say about it. Generally speaking, it is advisable for taxpayers to document their gambling activity and report any losses as this could result in tax deductions. There are limits, however, as to how much can be written off so always consult with an expert when trying to maximise your tax deductions.</p>

They’re packed with games of chance, as well as a thrilling atmosphere that can keep you on the edge of your seat all night long. If you’re looking to enjoy some great casino action and get away with your winnings, then look no further than the following tips!</p>
<h1 id="Choose-the-Right-Casino"><a href="#Choose-the-Right-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Choose the Right Casino"></a>Choose the Right Casino</h1><p>Not all casinos are created equal. Some are definitely better than others, so it’s important to do some research before settling on one. Look for a casino that has a good reputation and offers a wide variety of games. It should also be convenient to get to, so you don’t have any trouble getting there when the urge strikes.</p>
<h1 id="Know-What-You’re-Doing"><a href="#Know-What-You’re-Doing" class="headerlink" title="Know What You’re Doing"></a>Know What You’re Doing</h1><p>It’s never a good idea to go into a casino without knowing what you’re doing. In fact, this could lead to disaster very quickly. Make sure you know the rules of the games you’re playing and how to maximize your chances of winning. Most importantly, stick to budgets and limits that you’re comfortable with. No one wants to end up in debt after a trip to the casino!</p>
<h1 id="Drink-in-Moderation"><a href="#Drink-in-Moderation" class="headerlink" title="Drink in Moderation"></a>Drink in Moderation</h1><p>Drinking in moderation is always a good idea when visiting a casino. Alcohol can impair your judgment and make it difficult to make sound decisions. This can lead to losses that you wouldn’t ordinarily make if you were sober. So drink responsibly and remember that it’s always more fun to leave the casino a winner!</p>
