#  Arsenal FC accused of cheating by casino in blackjack shuffle

Arsenal Football Club has been accused of cheating by a casino in Blackjack after it was revealed that the players have been using a shuffle technique which gives them an advantage over the house.

The casino has alleged that the club has been using a ‘riffle’ or ‘throw’ to shuffle the cards which means that they can see which cards are coming up next, allowing them to make better betting decisions.

This is not the first time that Arsenal have been involved in a controversy surrounding Blackjack, as in 2009 they were caught using a similar technique at a casino in Manchester. At that time they were fined £25,000 by the Gambling Commission.

Arsenal have denied any wrongdoing and issued a statement saying that they “use a conventional riffle shuffle, which has been used by players for many years and is approved by casinos and gaming authorities.”

#  Casino claims Arsenal FC rigged blackjack shuffle to win

The Arsenal FC football club is in the midst of a cheating scandal, as casino bosses allege that members of the team conspired to rig blackjack games in order to win large profits.

According to casino officials, members of the Arsenal team would collaborate to ensure that they were always dealt favourable hands during blackjack games. In some cases, players are reported to have refused to take cards when they were already ahead in order to avoid weakening their hand.

In total, casino bosses estimate that the Arsenal team fleeced them out of over £1 million (US$1.3 million). They have since filed a lawsuit against the club, seeking restitution for their losses.

Arsenal has denied any wrongdoing, stating that they will “vigorously defend” themselves against the allegations. However, if found guilty, the club could face significant fines and even expulsion from major tournaments.

This is not the first time that allegations of cheating have surrounded Arsenal. In 2006, club captain Thierry Henry was caught using a fake handkerchief to manipulate the ball into crossing the goal line during a match against Spanish side Villarreal CF.

#  Arsenal FC denies cheating allegations, calls them absurd

Arsenal FC has strongly denied cheating allegations brought against the club by Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp.

"These accusations are absurd," an Arsenal spokesperson said in a statement. "We have always played fair and we would never do anything to gain an advantage over our opponents."

The accusations stem from Arsenal's 2-0 victory over Liverpool on Saturday, which some observers felt was aided by two questionable decisions by the referee.

First, Liverpool was denied what appeared to be a valid goal when Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech deflected a shot off the crossbar onto the line. Second, Arsenal was given a penalty kick late in the game which resulted in the club's second goal.

Fans of Liverpool and other clubs have taken to social media to accuse Arsenal of cheating, but Klopp refused to be drawn into that discussion after the match.

"I don't want to talk about this," Klopp said. "It's not my job to talk about this."

Arsenal has a history of being accused of tactics that some perceive as being unfair. The club has been known for its use of aggressive physical play and its reliance on defensive tactics that can often stifle opposing teams.

But while some may see these strategies as being unfair, they have nevertheless helped the club win three Premier League championships and thirteen FA Cup titles.

#  Casino demands investigation into Arsenal FC's blackjack shuffle

Arsenal FC, a London-based Premier League soccer club, is being asked to investigate its blackjack shuffle procedures after casino operators noticed what they allege are discrepancies in the deck.

The casino industry has long been suspicious of the way Arsenal shuffles its cards and believes that the club may be using marked decks in order to give itself an advantage. Manchester United, another top-level Premier League club, was also accused of cheating at blackjack in a previous investigation.

"There's no question that something is happening here," said one casino executive. " Arsenal has been winning far more hands than you would expect them to based on the odds. We believe that they're using a stacked deck and we want them to explain themselves."

Arsenal has denied any wrongdoing, stating that it uses a fair and random shuffle procedure. The club has also threatened to sue the casinos for libel if they continue to make these allegations.

But some experts believe that there may be something fishy going on. "It's true that Arsenal does have a good track record when it comes to blackjack," said one gambling analyst. "But that doesn't mean they're cheating. There could be any number of explanations for why they're winning more often than not."

Whether or not Arsenal is actually cheating remains to be seen. But if the allegations are proven true, it could spell big trouble for the Premier League club.

#  Arsenal FC slams casino for making false accusations

Arsenal FC has hit out at a casino, accusing it of making false accusations against the club in order to cover up its own failings.

The casino had claimed that Arsenal had refused to pay out a large jackpot, but the club has refuted these claims, insisting that they have always abided by the rules when it comes to gambling.

Arsenal FC stated that the casino was trying to shift the blame for its own mistakes, and that it was clear that they were just trying to save their own skin.

This is not the first time that Arsenal FC has been embroiled in a gambling controversy, as in 2012 the club was fined by the FA for breaching betting rules.
