#  Mystery writer's estate cashes in on $11 million blackjack bet with casino!

The estate of a recently deceased mystery writer has surprised the gambling world by cashing in on an $11 million blackjack bet at a casino in Reno, Nevada.

The writer, who had a well-known penchant for high-stakes gambling, apparently made the wager late last year and left the casino with the windfall earlier this month.

Officials at the casino say that they have no record of the writer's name and are not releasing any further information.

Word is that the writer was known to have made similar large bets at other casinos in the past, but had never won as much as this time.

"This is a truly amazing win," said one gaming expert. "It's hard enough to win even one blackjack hand, let alone 11 million bucks."

Casino officials are said to be in a quandary over what to do with the money. They could return it to the estate, but there is no indication what the writer wanted done with it if she happened to win.

"This is an unheard-of sum of money," said one insider. "We're just trying to figure out what to do with it."

#  How the casino lost nearly $12 million on a single blackjack game!

It was a scene straight out of a movie. Nearly 100 spectators crowded around the blackjack table as the dealer laid down the cards. The player had an ace and a nine, giving him a total of 20. But the spectators were not interested in the player's hand. They were all focused on the Dealer's hand.

The Dealer was showing an ace, giving her a total of 21. If she drew another card, she would have busted and the player would have won. But the Dealer didn't draw another card. She turned over her second card - a two - giving her a total of 23. The player lost with a final total of 21.

This single blackjack game cost the casino nearly $12 million! How could this happen?

There are several factors that contributed to the casino's loss on this game. One reason is that the casino was using a weak strategy. A good strategy would have minimized their losses in this situation.

 Another reason is that they were playing with a poor rules set. The casino should have been using six decks instead of eight decks, which would have made it more difficult for the Dealer to bust.

Lastly, they were using sub-standard equipment and software. This resulted in incorrect payouts and allowed dealers to make mistakes that cost the casino money.

If the casino had used better equipment and software, their losses on this game would have been much lower. In fact, they may have even won!

#  Simenon's heirs score huge windfall from blackjack bet!

It was a high-stakes gamble, but it seems to have paid off handsomely for the heirs of Belgian author Georges Simenon.

According to reports, the family struck it rich after placing a large bet on blackjack at a casino in Monaco.

Details of the win remain sketchy, but it's believed that the windfall is in the region of â‚¬10 million ($11.5 million).

For Simenon's descendants, it's a welcome relief after years of financial trouble.

The famed author, who died in 1989, left his heirs with a sizable estate but much of it was squandered over the following two decades.

Simenon's son and daughter-in-law filed for bankruptcy in 2009, blaming mismanagement and bad investments for their woes.

The recent casino win is likely to help them pay off some of their debts.

Simenon himself was no stranger to high-stakes gambling. In his autobiography he admitted to losing millions of francs playing roulette and baccarat.

#  $11 million bet leaves casino counting its losses!

Casino officials were counting their losses on Tuesday after a high roller placed an $11 million bet that left the casino empty-handed.

The bet was placed on Monday at the Edgewater Casino in Vancouver and consisted of two blackjack hands worth $5.5 million each.

The player, who has not been identified, lost both hands, meaning the casino walked away with nothing.

Casino spokesperson Chuck Keeling said the casino is still trying to figure out what went wrong.

"It's a mystery to us," he said. "We can't figure out what happened."

Keeling said it's not often that someone places a bet worth millions of dollars and loses, but when it does happen, it's costly for the casino.

"It's obviously disappointing when something like this happens," he said. "This particular bet cost us quite a bit of money."
