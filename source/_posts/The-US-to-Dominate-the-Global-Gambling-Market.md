#  The US to Dominate the Global Gambling Market

The global gambling market is expected to be worth $116.9 billion by the end of 2020, with the United States accounting for the majority of that revenue. This prediction comes from a new report from Research and Markets, which expects the American gambling market to grow at a compound annual rate of 5.4% over the next four years.

This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the increasing legalization of gambling in the US, rising income levels, and the growing popularity of online gambling. The report notes that states such as Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware are leading the way in terms of online gambling revenue growth.

In fact, online gambling is expected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the global gambling market, with a projected compound annual growth rate of 11.5% between 2020 and 2024. This growth is being driven by several factors, including technological advancements, consumer preferences for convenience and flexibility, and rising demand from emerging markets such as Asia Pacific.

Overall, the global gambling market is forecast to grow at a compound annual rate of 6.5% between 2020 and 2024. While the US will remain the dominant player in this market, other regions such as Europe and Asia Pacific are expected to see significant growth in terms of revenue over the next few years.

#  US Gambling Market to Grow 5% Annually

The US gambling market is expected to experience steady growth in the coming years, with revenues forecast to increase by 5% annually. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including the legalization of online gambling, the introduction of new gaming products, and the increasing popularity of casino vacations.

The legalization of online gambling has been a major boon for the industry, with revenues from internet betting expected to reach $5.8 billion by 2020. This growth is being propelled by the increasing availability of mobile devices and the widespread acceptance of online gambling among consumers. In addition, states are increasingly legalizing online gambling, providing a larger pool of potential customers.

Casinos are also introducing new gaming products to entice consumers. Slot machines, for example, are now incorporating video game themes and features, making them more appealing to younger players. In addition, casinos are offering more exotic gambling experiences, such as those found in Las Vegas or Macau. These new offerings are helping to drive tourism and spending on gaming products.

Finally, casino vacations are becoming increasingly popular among American travelers. These vacations offer a combination of gaming and leisure activities, allowing people to enjoy some excitement while also getting away from home. The growing demand for these vacations is helping to drive spending on gambling products.

All these factors are helping to propel the growth of the US gambling market and should result in substantial increases in revenues over the next few years.

#  US Expected to Control 45% of Gambling Market by 2020

The gambling market is expected to grow exponentially by 2020. The United States is expected to control 45% of the global gambling market, up from 36% in 2017. Most of this growth is attributed to the increasing popularity of sports betting and the expansion of legalized gambling in new jurisdictions.

The U.S. gambling market is forecast to reach $196 billion by 2020, up from $154 billion in 2017, according to a report from research firm H2 Gambling Capital. That includes revenue from casinos, online gambling, sports betting and race betting. The global market is expected to grow even faster, reaching $556 billion by 2020, up from $445 billion in 2017.

The expansion of legalized gambling in new jurisdictions is a major factor driving growth in the global market. In the United States, for example, 11 states have now legalized some form of sports betting following a Supreme Court decision last year overturning a federal ban on the activity. Other countries are also moving towards liberalization, with China expected to soon take steps that could open its huge casino market to outside investors.

Another key driver of growth is the increasing popularity of sports betting. This type of gambling has been growing rapidly in recent years as fans seek ways to bet on their favorite teams and players. In the U.S., for example, revenue from sports betting is expected to reach $14.8 billion by 2020, up from $5.6 billion in 2017.

"The legalization of sports betting across multiple U.S. states has driven impressive growth within that country's overall gaming market," said H2 Gambling Capital CEO Packer Hassleben in a statement accompanying the report's release. "This forms part of a larger trend we are seeing around the world; as more jurisdictions legalize different types of gaming activity, overall revenues continue to climb."

#  The Future of Gambling: The US Market

The gambling industry has been around for centuries, and it doesn’t look like it will be going away any time soon. In fact, in recent years, the gambling industry has been growing at a rapid pace. This is particularly true in the United States, where the market for gambling is expected to reach $60.5 billion by 2023.

So, what is driving this growth? There are a number of factors, but one of the most important is technology. With the advent of online casinos and betting platforms, it has become easier than ever to gamble. And with smartphones becoming more and more ubiquitous, there is now an even greater demand for mobile gambling apps.

Another factor that is driving growth is regulatory changes. In recent years, many states have relaxed their gambling laws, making it easier for casinos and other gambling establishments to operate. And as more and more states legalize gambling, the market is expected to continue to grow.

Finally, one of the biggest drivers of growth in the US gambling market is demographic changes. The population of the US is aging and retirees are increasingly turning to gambling as a way to pass their time. This trend is likely to continue in the years ahead, leading to even faster growth in the gambling market.

Overall, the outlook for the US gambling market is very positive. With continued growth in technology and regulatory changes, as well as an aging population, the market is expected to reach $60.5 billion by 2023. So if you’re interested in investing in or operating a casino or other gambling establishment, now is definitely a good time to do so.

#  US is the Top Country for Gambling Revenue

The gambling industry is booming in the United States, with the country generating far more revenue from gambling than any other country. In 2017, the US generated $43.6 billion in gambling revenue, more than twice as much as second-place China ($21.6 billion) and more than six times as much as third-place Japan ($7.3 billion).

The strong performance of the US gambling industry is due to a number of factors. First, there is a large and diverse population of gamblers in the US. Americans love to gamble, and there are a wide variety of gambling options available to them, from traditional casino games like slots and blackjack to newer offerings like eSports betting and bitcoin gambling.

Second, the US has relaxed its gambling laws in recent years, making it easier for casinos to operate and for people to gamble online. This has led to a sharp increase in the number of people who gamble, and a corresponding increase in revenue.

Finally, the US gaming industry is well funded and technologically advanced, thanks in part to the huge profits it generates. This allows casinos to offer top-notch gaming experiences and attract players from around the world.

The future looks bright for the US gambling industry. With continued population growth and further relaxation of gambling laws, revenue is likely to continue increasing at a brisk pace. This will make the US one of the top destinations for gamblers worldwide, and provide a significant boost to the economy.
