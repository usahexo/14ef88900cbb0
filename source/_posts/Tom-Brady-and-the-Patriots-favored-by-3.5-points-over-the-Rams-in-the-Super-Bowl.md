#  Tom Brady and the Patriots favored by 3.5 points over the Rams in the Super Bowl

The New England Patriots are three-point favorites over the Los Angeles Rams in the Super Bowl, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers.

Tom Brady and the Patriots have been one of the most dominant teams in the NFL over the past two decades, winning six championships since 2001. The Rams, on the other hand, haven’t been to a Super Bowl in nearly two decades and are looking to win their first championship since their move to Los Angeles.

While Brady is considered one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, Jared Goff has emerged as one of the top young quarterbacks in the league this season. Goff led the Rams to a 13-3 record this season, while Brady and the Patriots went 11-5.

Both teams have star players on both sides of the ball. The Patriots have Rob Gronkowski at tight end and Julian Edelman at wide receiver. The Rams have Todd Gurley at running back and Aaron Donald at defensive lineman.

Las Vegas oddsmakers say that there is a good chance that this could be a high-scoring game. The over/under for total points scored is set at 57.5.

#  The Golden State Warriors are underdogs against the Houston Rockets

The Golden State Warriors are underdogs against the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. The Rockets have home court advantage and they are a very good team. The Warriors will have to play well to beat them.

The Rockets have James Harden, who is one of the best players in the NBA. They also have Chris Paul, who is a great point guard. The Warriors will need to stop both of them if they want to win.

The Warriors are a very good team themselves. They have Stephen Curry,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) who is one of the best players in the league. They also have Klay Thompson, who is a great shooter. If they can get these two players going, they will be tough to beat.

It should be a great series between these two teams. It will be exciting to see who wins.

#  Odds show that the Cleveland Cavaliers have a 66.6% chance to win the NBA Finals

The Cleveland Cavaliers have had a spectacular season so far. With just a few games left in the season, they hold the number one seed in the Eastern Conference. And if their record is any indication of how they’ll do in the playoffs, they’re likely to be a formidable opponent for any team that makes it to the Finals – including the Golden State Warriors.

In fact, according to Vegas odds, the Cavs have a 66.6% chance of winning the championship this year. This may come as a surprise to some people, who may remember that the Cavs were beaten by the Warriors in last year’s Finals. But with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love back on the team, along with LeBron James – who is having an MVP-quality season – there’s good reason to believe that Cleveland has what it takes to win it all this year.

There are some other teams that could potentially give Cleveland a run for its money in the playoffs. The Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors are both strong teams, and either of them could potentially make it to the Finals. But at this point, it seems unlikely that either of them would be able to beat out Cleveland in a 7-game series.

So if you’re looking for an NBA Finals bet, your best bet is probably to put your money on the Cavs. They have proved themselves time and time again this season, and there’s no reason to believe that they won’t come out on top in June.

#  The Philadelphia Eagles are 3-point favorites over the New England Patriots on Sunday

The Philadelphia Eagles will be looking for their fourth Super Bowl ring when they take on the New England Patriots this Sunday. The Eagles come into the game as 3-point favorites, and they have good reason to be confident. Philly has been one of the best teams in the NFL all season, while the Patriots have been a bit inconsistent.

The Eagles have a strong offense led by quarterback Nick Foles. Foles had a great regular season, throwing for 27 touchdowns and just two interceptions. He has also been playing well in the playoffs, throwing four touchdowns and no interceptions. The Eagles' offense will be facing a tough test against the Patriots' defense, but they have enough firepower to get the job done.

The Patriots' offense is led by quarterback Tom Brady. Brady had a somewhat mediocre regular season, throwing for just 29 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. However, he has been playing much better in the playoffs, throwing for six touchdowns and no interceptions. The Patriots will need Brady to continue playing well if they want to beat the Eagles.

The Eagles have the edge on defense, and that should be enough to get them the win on Sunday. Look for them to cover the spread and win by at least a touchdown.

#  The Chicago Cubs are 8/1 underdogs to win the World Series this year

The Chicago Cubs are 8/1 underdogs to win the World Series this year. The last time they won the World Series was in 1908, which is also the last time they were in the World Series. The Cubs have not made it to the playoffs since 2003.

This year, the Cubs are led by manager Joe Maddon, who is coming off a World Series win with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008. Maddon is known for being a great motivator and for his creative tactics.

The Cubs’ lineup is led by first baseman Anthony Rizzo and outfielder Kris Bryant. Rizzo hit .278 with 32 homers and 101 RBIs last year, and Bryant hit .275 with 26 homers and 99 RBIs. In addition, shortstop Addison Russell hit .238 with 21 homers and 95 RBIs as a rookie last year.

The Cubs’ pitching staff is led by Jake Arrieta, who was 18-8 with a 2.53 ERA last year. Arrieta finished third in NL Cy Young voting. In addition, Jason Hammel (15-10, 3.83 ERA) and Jon Lester (19-5, 2.44 ERA) are both solid starters. The bullpen is anchored by closer Hector Rondon, who had 34 saves and a 1.67 ERA last year.

Overall, the Cubs appear to be a very strong team heading into the 2016 season. They will be looking to end their 108-year championship drought this year.
