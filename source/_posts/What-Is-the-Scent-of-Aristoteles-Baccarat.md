#  How to Create an Aristoteles Baccarat Scented Candle

Most people think of candles as a way to create ambiance or to make a space smell nice. But at their heart, candles are a form of art. They can be used to communicate ideas, tell stories, and evoke emotions.

For this project, we're going to create an Aristoteles Baccarat scented candle. This candle is inspired by the baccarat game and is meant to evoke feelings of luxury, sophistication, and winners' circles.

To make this candle, you will need:

1/2 cup beeswax pellets

1/4 cup soy wax flakes

Aromatic oil of your choice (we recommend baccarat)

A few drops of food coloring (optional)

Candle wicks

 melting pot or stovetop

mold for the candle (we recommend a glass hurricane jar)



# Instructions:

 1. Begin by heating your wax in a melting pot or on the stovetop. You want the wax to reach about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. If you're using a melting pot, be sure to stir the wax occasionally so that it doesn't burn.


 2. Once the wax has reached the desired temperature, add in your aromatic oil and food coloring (if using). Stir until everything is well combined.

 3. Cut your wicks to the desired length and then thread them through the holes in your mold.

 4. Carefully pour the wax into your mold, making sure to center the wicks as you go. Allow the candles to cool completely before removing them from the mold.
