#  What are the five reasons?

In todays world, the majority of people are always looking for a reason to do something. The most common question people ask themselves is "why?" People tend to overthink and complicate things, but when it comes down to it, there are really only five reasons why someone would do something:

1. To make themselves happy

This is the most common reason for people to do anything. They do what makes them happy and try to avoid anything that will make them unhappy.

2. To make someone else happy

When it comes down to it, most people want to make those around them happy. This is either done out of love or out of a genuine desire to see others happy.

3. Out of a sense of duty or responsibility

Some people feel they need to do something in order to live up to their responsibilities or duties. They feel an obligation to act in a certain way and this motivates them to do something.

4. Fear or greed

Sometimes people do things out of fear or greed. They may be afraid of losing something they value or they may be greedy for something they want. These motives can be very powerful drivers for people's actions.


5) To comply with social norms or expectations

In some cases, people do things because they feel they have to in order to fit in or comply with social norms or expectations. This can be a strong motivator for some people's behavior

#  What type of roofs are available?

There are a variety of roofing types to choose from when re-roofing your home. The most popular type of roof is the asphalt shingle roof. This roof is affordable, durable, and easy to install. Asphalt shingle roofs come in a variety of colors and styles to match the look of your home.

If you are looking for a more durable roof, metal roofs are a great option. Metal roofs are fire-resistant and can last up to 50 years. They are also eco-friendly, as they are made from recycled materials.

If you want a roof that is both stylish and functional, consider a slate or tile roof. Slate and tile roofs are durable and can last for up to 100 years. They also add character and value to your home.

No matter what type of roof you choose, be sure to hire a qualified contractor to install it correctly. A poorly installed roof can lead to leaks and other damage to your home.

#  What are the benefits of a new roof?

There are many benefits of a new roof, but one of the most important is its ability to protect your home from the elements. A new roof can keep your home dry and in good condition, which can add value to your property and save you money in the long run.

Another important benefit of a new roof is that it can improve your home's energy efficiency. A properly installed roof can help keep your home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, which can lead to lower energy bills.

A third benefit of a new roof is that it can increase your home's security. A good roof will not only protect you from the weather, but it will also deter thieves by making it more difficult for them to get into your home.

Overall, there are many benefits of a new roof, so if you are considering getting one, be sure to research all of your options and find a qualified contractor who can do the job right.

#  How much does a new roof cost?

A new roof can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the size and type of roof, the materials used, and the labor required.

The average cost of a new roof in the United States is around $6,000, but this figure can vary widely depending on the location and other factors. For example, a new roof in California is likely to be more expensive than one in Iowa due to the cost of labor and materials in each state.

There are a variety of factors that can affect the cost of a new roof, including:

- The size and slope of the roof
- The type of roofing material used
- Whether the roof needs to be replaced or just repaired
- Accessibility to the roof (if it's difficult to get onto, that will add to the cost)
- The contractor you hire

The most common types of roofing materials are asphalt shingles, wood shingles or shakes, tile, and membrane roofs (like rubber or plastic). Asphalt shingles are generally the most affordable option, while slate or tile roofs are typically the most expensive.

If your roof is damaged and needs to be repaired rather than replaced, that will also affect the price. A small repair job might only cost a few hundred dollars, but a large repair could run into the thousands.

It's important to get several quotes from different contractors before deciding on a new roof so you can get an accurate idea of how much it will cost. Ask friends and family for recommendations, or check with your local Home Builders Association or Chamber of Commerce for recommendations.

#  What is the warranty?

When you purchase a product, you usually expect that the product will work as advertised and be covered by a warranty in case of defects. The warranty is a guarantee from the manufacturer that the product will be repaired or replaced at no cost to the consumer, usually for a specific time period.

Products with limited warranties typically cover manufacturing defects only and do not cover accidental damage or wear and tear. Warranties on appliances, electronics, and other big ticket items may also include provisions for service calls and/or labor costs.

It's important to read the warranty carefully before you buy a product, so you know what is and is not covered. If you have a problem with a product later on, your first step should be to contact the manufacturer or store where you purchased the product. Many manufacturers have toll-free numbers and websites where you can file a claim.

If the problem is not resolved after contacting the manufacturer, you may need to take legal action. You can speak with an attorney who specializes in consumer law to find out your options.
