#  How does Live Casino House let it ride poker,Edict,let it ride poker Bolivia work?

Even if you're an experienced gambler, the rules of how to play let it ride poker can be confusing. That's because this casino game can be played several different ways. But don't worry, we'll explain how to play let it ride poker using the most popular variation: straight let it ride.

Straight let it ride is a three-card poker game in which the player wagers on a five-card hand made up of their own cards and two community cards that are dealt face up. The aim of the game is to beat the dealers hand, or at least not have a worse hand.

To begin, players must first place an Ante bet. This is a mandatory bet and determines how much the player will win or lose on their hand, whether they hit a royal flush or lose with a pair of deuces.

After placing the Ante bet, players receive three cards face down. The dealer also receives three cards, two of which are placed face up for all players to see. These are called the 'flop'.

 At this point in the game, players have two choices: fold or let it ride. If a player chooses to fold, they forfeit their Ante bet and all interest in the hand. If they choose to let it ride, they must place an additional equal bet (called the 'play' bet).

The dealer then reveals their fourth card, called the 'turn'. At this point in the game, if any player has a pair or better they must show their hand and collect twice their Bet Amount + 1 chip for every extra card over two (so 3 eg), capped at 10 chips. E.g A player with Ace-King-Queen would get paid 11 chips (2+1 for each extra card). If no one has revealed anything yet, then everyone checks - see belowdefinition for more information on what this means. 
At this point there are two stages left in the game: The River Card and Showdown .

     So far we’ve described four out of seven stages in Let It Ride Poker: 

  1) Determine players’ hands by using 3 cards from personal stack and 2 from board ;
2) Compare each player’sLet It Ride Poker hand against dealer’s revealed 4th card;
3) If any player has declared “Let It Ride” on previous round and his/her“hand beats dealer ’ s fourth card , collects double his original Bet Amount wagered plus one additional chip for each card over two (face value) – capped at 10 chips; 
4) Dealer burns one card and places final card face down – turn called River Card;

Now we come to stage 5) Showdown - where remaining players reveal their hands to determine winner; followed by stage 6) Payouts .

 Before describing payouts procedure , here’s another example showing what action needs to be taken at Stage 3 given different combinations: 

Player 1 has Ace-King-Queen = 11 points total; 
Player 2 has Jack-8-7 = 20 points total; 
Dealer has Queen-10-5 = 25 points total . In this case , Player 1 would automatically lose since dealer has higher scoring hand . Therefore , showdown isn’t necessary .

Assuming no one folds before showdown (and therefore reaching stage 5), then both players still in game reveal their hands simultaneously and compare against dealer's fifth card - as seen in following table:

If Player Hand Beats Dealer's Hand...Then Player Gets These Payouts:

Ace high or better Twice normal bet amount +1 chip for each extra card over two(face value), capped at 10 chips Pair of 10s or better Twice normal bet amount +1 chip for each extra card over two(face value), capped at 10 chips Twopair pays Double normal bet amount Straight pays 4x normal bet amount Flush pays 6x normal bet amount Full house pays 9x normal bet amount Four of kind pays 12x normal bet amount Straight flush pays 25x normal bet amount Royal flush pays 50x normal bet amount

Now that we know how payouts work, returning back to our previous example - if either player had Ace high or better , they would automatically win illustrated payout above . Same goes for any other winning combination shown in table . So , overall Let It Ride Poker is relatively simple game once basic rules are understood
